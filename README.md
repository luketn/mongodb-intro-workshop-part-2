Follow on to mongodb-intro-workshop.

## Setup
If you don't already have it, follow the setup instructions from the intro workshop:
https://github.com/luketn/mongodb-intro-workshop#setup

We'll use the same Docker based mongo instance for playing with performance tools and indexes.

In addition, I recommend installing MongoDB Compass:
