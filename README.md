Follow on to mongodb-intro-workshop.

## Setup
If you don't already have it, follow the setup instructions from the intro workshop:
https://github.com/luketn/mongodb-intro-workshop#setup

We'll use the same Docker based mongo instance for playing with performance tools and indexes.

In addition, I recommend installing MongoDB Compass:  
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/install/

And Robo3T:
